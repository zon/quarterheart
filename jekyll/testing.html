<div id="testing" class="section">
	<h2>Alpha Testing</h2>
	<p>There isn't any in game communication system, so we meet using <a href="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/">Mumble</a> voice chat. A mircophone isn't required, but you'll be sad without one. The Mumble server is on <strong>quarterheart.com</strong> running on the default port without a password.</p>
	<p>First everyone will meet on the Mumble server. Then a game will be hosted for everyone to join. Testing only takes around 30 minutes, but the host will run as long as people are playing.</p>
